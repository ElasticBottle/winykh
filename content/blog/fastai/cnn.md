What to do?

## Neural Networks

## Convolution Neural networks

### Kernels

#### Types of Kernels

- Sobel top/bottom/left/right
- Identity
- Emboss
- blur

## Regularization

### Drop Out

with percentage $p$, remove a particular node from that training iteration

### Weight Decay

Add a penalty for having the magnitude of the weights become too large.

## Normalization

### INput Normalization

### BAtch Normalization

## Training Optimization

### Momentum

Have the update be based on current gradient and previous gradient.

### RMS Prop

### Adam
