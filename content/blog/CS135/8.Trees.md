Some terminologies for dealing with trees:

* Root - A single node in the tree will be a root (It has no parent)
* Node
  * Leaf - Leaf nodes have to children
  * Internal - Nodes with children
  * Parent
  * Children
* Ancestors - The parent of a node $n$ up to the root
* Descendants - The children of node $n$ down to the leaves
* Subtree - Rooted at node $n$ and all of its descendants
* Labels - Data associated with a node

## Characteristics of a tree

Trees have many characteristics. Some of the more important ones pertain too:

* Number of internal nodes
  * Exactly two, at most two, any number
* Label locations
  * On the leaves, on every internal node
* Order of children
  * Matters or not
* Tree structure
  * Derived from data or for convenience

## Binary Trees

Binary trees are the simplest of trees.

The main feature is that each internal node has **at most 2 children**.

Here's how we'd define a tree structure

```racket
(define-struct node (key left right))
;; A Node is a (make-node Any BT BT)

;; A binary tree (BT) is one of:
;; - empty
;; - Node
```

### Searching Binary Trees

Searching binary tree is simply a matter of checking if the current key is not empty and is what we are looking for.

If it isn't, we simply recurse on the left and right subtrees.

```racket
(define (contains? tree k)
  (and (not (empty? tree))
       (or
        (= k (node-key tree))
        (contains? (node-left tree) k)
        (contains? (node-right tree) k))))
```

But of course, this is about as efficient as a linear search in a list. That is $O(n)$ runtime.

Can we do better?

Let's take a look at binary search trees.

## Binary Search Trees

```racket
;; A binary search tree (BST) is one of:
;; - empty
;; - Node

(define-struct Node (key left right))
;; a Node is a (make-node Any BST BST)
;; Requires:
;;  - key > key of every node in left
;;  - key < key of every node in right
```

Because of the ordering property of the `key` in BST, we can save on one recursive function call.

That is, if we know the value we want to `add`, `search`, `remove`, and it is less than the root node's value, then we only need to search the left subtree.

## Augmenting Trees

With BST, we  can begin to tag additional data along with each node:

```racket
(define-struct node (key value left right))
;; a Node is a (make-std Any Any BST BST)
;; Requires:
;;  - key > key of every node in left
;;  - key < key of every node in right
```

With this, we can implement a dictionary binary search tree.

## Traversing a Tree

The notion of tree traversal refers to visiting each node of a tree exactly once.

There are 3 ways we can go about our traversal:

### Pre-order

Pre-order traversal visits the root first then each subtree.

```python
def traverse(tree):
  do_something(get_root(tree))
  do_something(get_left_branch(tree))
  do_something(get_right_branch(tree))
```

Something like:

```python
def traverse(tree):
  result = [
    get_root(tree),
    do_something(get_left_branch(tree)),
    do_something(get_right_branch(tree)),
  ]
  return result
```

is also considered to be pre-order traversal.

### In-order

In-order traversal visit the subtree, the roots, then the next subtree

```python
def traverse(tree):
  do_something(get_left_branch(tree))
  do_something(get_root(tree))
  do_something(get_right_branch(tree))
```

### Post-order

Post-order traversal visits each subtree first, then the root.

```python
def traverse(tree):
  do_something(get_left_branch(tree))
  do_something(get_right_branch(tree))
  do_something(get_root(tree))
```

## General Trees

With general trees, we can have more than two children.

In that case, instead of having a `left` and `right` data structure, we can use a list.

This will allow us to represent an arbitrary amount of children.

```racket
;; a Tree is one of:
;; * Num
;; * A General-Tree

(define-struct general-tree (value lot))
;; a GeneralTree is a (make-general-tree Any (listof Tree))

;; tree-template: Tree -> Any
(define (tree-template tree)
  (cond
    [(num? tree) ...]
    [(general-tree? tree) (general-tree-template tree)]))

;; general-tree-tempate: GeneralTree -> Any
(define (general-tree-template tree)
  (... (general-tree-value tree)
       (tree-template (general-tree-lot tree)) ...))
```
